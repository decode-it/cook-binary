## 1.2.2

* Added support for cmake position-independent code
* Added support for multiple force include files for cmake via the `SHELL:` annotation (requires cmake 3.12+)

## 1.2.3

* debug does not imply rtc by default (use -T rtc)

## 1.2.4

* Support for response files for input files (by default, gcc/clang/msvc link & archive use this)
* Update on ninja rule names

## 1.2.5

* Add quotes around all files in msvc, gcc and clang toolchain files.

## 1.2.6

* Quotes are no longer in toolchain files, but inside commands.

## 1.2.7

* `cmake_minimum_required` is now version 3.12 (from 3.1), which is needed for the `SHELL:` prefix in `target_compile_options()`
* Don't use /MD(d) option when compiler is msvc rc (Resource)
* Reverse the order of object files in the response file
* CMake: Archive from objects only possible

## 1.2.8

* Chaiscript File.open() works in binary mode now

## 1.2.9

* MSVC fix: added the `/DEBUG` flag during linking to allow actual debugging in debug mode
* When a compile toolchain element is missing, cook will now report what source files are actually requiring this language support.
* Added gcc support for sysroot
* Added gcc support for a53
* Fixed bug in gcc toolchain: enabling profiling via `-T profile` resulted in `-g` compilation flag iso `-pg`.

## 1.2.10
* Toolchain has a `set_intermediary_namer` function to set the name for intermediary files (temporary fix)
* chai file IO is by default non-binary

## 1.2.11
* File functionality exposed in chai (join, each\_line, absolute)

## 1.2.12
* More file functionality exposed in chai (basename, dirname, extname)
* Exposing toolchain configuration per recipe in chai

## 1.2.13
* Different extensions for assembly
* Response file for command line arguments

## 1.2.14

* Added support for Recipe.remove(dir, rel, flags, functor)
* Added documentation for Recip.remove()

## 1.2.16
* Type and Flag can easilty be extended, e.g., Type.A = Type.UserDefined()
* ToolchainElement has a `set_ingredient_processor` callback function:
   * bool (ToolchainElement, Recipe, Ingredient): should return true if the propagation for this ingredient should stop, false otherwise
* `include` has no automatic guards against multiple inclusion
* Command line option `-I` adds extra directories to seach when using `include` in chai
* `include_relative` only tries to include from the relative directory
* `load` loads and evaluates the file without any guards

## 1.2.17
* Better propagation of linked libraries

## 1.2.18
* Archives are deleted before rebuilding

## 1.2.19
* Quoting arguments if command should delete before rebuiding (on windows)

## 1.2.20
* Support for older LIBC version for linux (built on top of ubuntu16.04)
* GCC-like toolchains use `ar crs` now for non-MacOS as well, iso the previous `ar crf` that causes problems due to the truncated object filenames

## 1.2.21
* Support for the time protection of a directory (all files inside this directory) or a file
* Using absolute filenames 
* Performance update

## 1.2.22
* The `cmake` generator now sets the `link_directories()` for a shared library as well
* The `cmake` generator correctly uses the `set_source_files_properties()` to indicate `Type.Header` files
* The default `clang` toolchain now supports the `-T target=<value>` toolchain option, which can eg. be set to `-T target=x86_64-apple-macos11.03` for Intel or `-T target=arm64-apple-macos11.3`for M1 Apple Silicon

## 1.2.23
* The toolchain configuration key-value pairs (-T key=value) are processed per priority new iso alphabetically. This allows a toolchain.configuration callback to check for other configuration key-value pairs to make a join decision. This was needed for handling the MSVC runtime compiler flags (/MT, /MTd, /MD, /MDd) and libraries: this is a combination of config:debug/release and c++.runtime dynamic/static. The trick with the Part.Runtime is gone now.
* Added `_DEBUG` and `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=2` for MSVC debug builds

## 1.2.24
* Unhandled configuration key-values disappeared in v1.2.23, now, they remain available for inspection by the recipes.

## 1.2.25
* For MSVC for TargetType.SharedLibrary (DLL) builds using dynamic runtime (c++.runtime=dynamic), the `mfcs140u` and `mfcs140ud` libraries are used iso `msvcrt` and `msvcrtd`.
* When a configuration key-value is processed, it is still available in the board when it is being processed.

## 1.2.26
* Key-value configuration values are now processed per-element, as was the case for 1.2.22.
* Support for building cook with C++20
* Support for generating compile commands with `rake gencc`

## 1.2.27
* Support for `c++.noexcept`
* Removed MSVC link against `mfcs140u`
* Added `.clang-format` file

## 1.2.28
* Support for `c++.runtime=static` for clang.
* Unknown `c++.runtime` value is now properly indicated

## Next

* Remove Part.Runtime, it is probably not needed anymore since v1.2.23
* Support for `COOK_PATH` search for scripts
* Internal #include-based dependency detection for compilers that cannot output dependencies
* Defines specified at toolchain level (eg NOMINMAX for MSVC) should be translated into cmake as well
* Add support for relative (parent) path in the recipe.add() method. e.g. `r.add("some/include/dir", "../some/other/path/*.[hp](pp)?")`
* Support in cmake for self-chosen archive name, see `scenario/app_arch_func`
* Link with gcc iso g++, adding -lstdc++ when binary items are present that carry the c++ language. When adding libraries, we should be able to control this, and avoid adding the -lstdc++ lib during linking.
